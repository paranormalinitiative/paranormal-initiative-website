# TPI Development Agent Handoff

Last verified: 2026-10-24
Current controlling directive: TPI MASTER — Standing Autonomous Agent Authority

## Mandatory authority update

Read `100-DIRECTIVES/TPI-MASTER-AUTONOMOUS-AGENT-AUTHORITY.md`. Agents now have
standing authority to investigate, repair, test, commit, push, perform guarded
production deployment, verify live, and roll back. Do not stop for a routine
repairable blocker or require a fresh owner directive for each lifecycle step.
Historical restrictions below describe prior executions and do not override
the controlling directive.

- Worker ownership: launchd-owned by `com.tpi.local-development`

The authoritative StudioFlow source is the separate repository:
`/Users/toddknipple/Documents/StudioFlow/web`. The website `studio/` directory
is an integrated generated copy plus maintained TPI bridge files. Use
`node scripts/stage-studioflow-authoritative.mjs` in verification-only mode to
build twice and compare the candidate before any reviewed `--apply` operation.
The complete commit/push/deploy distinction is documented in
`TPI-STUDIOFLOW-SOURCE-TO-LIVE-WORKFLOW.md`; use it instead of inferring current
procedure from historical directive or completion records.

Preserve unrelated tracked and untracked changes. Focused commits and pushes to
`codex/tpi-development` are authorized after the applicable checks pass. Do not
reset, clean, stash, force-push, or rewrite history as a routine shortcut.

## TPI-STUDIOFLOW-033 current handoff

The configuration persistence repair is deployed and live-verified. The focused regression
`npm run verify:studioflow-033-roundtrip` passed 26/26 against the local Worker
with disposable Firefox Studios. It covers `videoClipSlots`, validated slot
positions, scalar `programOrientation`, existing Background Music fields,
stale-save rejection, Studio A/B switching, isolation, and refresh restoration.

Authoritative StudioFlow source commit: `53bf8dc` in
`/Users/toddknipple/Documents/StudioFlow/web`. The completion record and field
inventory are:

- `300-COMPLETED-WORK/2026-10-24-TPI-STUDIOFLOW-033-WORKSPACE-CONFIGURATION-PERSISTENCE.md`
- `TPI-STUDIOFLOW-WORKSPACE-CONFIGURATION.md`

Production Worker `5c8e78b5-f920-4335-940f-a5e4d6df0e49` is active at 100%
traffic. The immediate rollback is `0c0a8660-21cf-47e1-ac66-98c91b26972c`.
The live non-destructive release acceptance passed 64/64 and anonymous smoke
passed 10/10. The new 033 disposable server round-trip remains local evidence;
live acceptance did not mutate production Studio configuration.

## Latest verified production release

The latest release is TPI-STUDIOFLOW-033: application commit `cb38061`, Worker
`5c8e78b5-f920-4335-940f-a5e4d6df0e49`, rollback
`0c0a8660-21cf-47e1-ac66-98c91b26972c`. It is `DEPLOYED / LIVE VERIFIED`.
The configuration normalizer and hydration repair passed the focused 26/26
local round-trip; guarded live smoke and Firefox acceptance passed 10/10 and
64/64. The prior TPI-034 mutation repair remains in the deployed baseline.
Full evidence is in the TPI-033 completion record.

Deployment commit `6a1f8ad77649f1ef175a5191396d55a45141764c`
(TPI-STUDIOFLOW-032 — Background Music and Sound Effects icon replacement;
feature commit `02056c1`) was deployed to Worker `theparanormalinitiative`
as version `7029c6c5-3994-42a1-9570-d6119a5792f3` at 100% traffic on
2026-10-24. The release passed the 021 browser suite 31/31 (two
consecutive runs), 028 browser 33/33 (twice), the 030 sound-effects suite
25/25 (twice), the 031 music-pad suite 34/34 (twice), 021 static
contracts 86/86, 020 playback 14/14, 020 video clips 13/13, 027 contracts
12/12, 031 overlays 12/12, release safety 17/17, the complete local auth
lifecycle (isolated Firefox 64/64), complete preflight, the guarded
Wrangler dry-run, and the guarded live acceptance against production
64/64 (`DEPLOYED_AND_VERIFIED`). Both pad artwork files were verified
serving byte-identical on production. Crossroads, D1, R2, and owner
browser storage were not modified. The current approved StudioFlow playback
contract and regression history are in `TPI-STUDIOFLOW-PLAYBACK-CONTRACT.md`.

## Latest StudioFlow repair

The deployed change is documented in
`300-COMPLETED-WORK/2026-10-24-TPI-STUDIOFLOW-033-WORKSPACE-CONFIGURATION-PERSISTENCE.md`.
The API now preserves Video Clips assignments, validated slot positions, and
scalar program orientation through server round-trips and Studio activation.
The focused disposable API/Firefox regression passed 26/26. The prior
TPI-032 pad-artwork behavior remains in the deployed baseline.
The audio pads now show the owner-approved per-category artwork inside the
unchanged circular icon container — Waveform on Background Music pads,
Microphone on Sound Effects pads (`studio/Waveform.png` and
`studio/Microphone.png`, byte-identical to the owner's Desktop originals,
which were left untouched). The artwork is proportion-preserving and
pointer-transparent; pad layout, playback, drag-and-drop, context menus,
and the TPI-030/031 interfaces are unchanged. The 021 browser suite's
obsolete home-screen entry was repaired (each run seeds a fresh
browser-local recording broadcast — the same empty-state studio the home
"Record without going live" flow creates — with all assertions unchanged),
which also ends the disposable test-account studio pollution recorded as
TPI-030 finding 3. The TPI-033 normalizer gaps are resolved, and the TPI-034
bridge mutation storm repair remains in the deployed baseline. The 028 scene playback
workflow
(`300-COMPLETED-WORK/2026-10-23-TPI-STUDIOFLOW-028-SCENE-MEDIA-SHORTCUT-REPAIR.md`,
including its Addendum A section), the TPI-030 Sound Effects work
(`300-COMPLETED-WORK/2026-10-23-TPI-STUDIOFLOW-030-SOUND-EFFECTS-PAD-REORDERING.md`),
and the TPI-031 Background Music work
(`300-COMPLETED-WORK/2026-10-24-TPI-STUDIOFLOW-031-BACKGROUND-MUSIC-PAD-REORDERING.md`)
remain untouched in the deployed baseline.
Use the disposable Firefox acceptance profile for future checks; do not use
the owner profile for destructive testing.

The automated production acceptance gate must use the disposable Firefox
window titled `TPI ISOLATED LIVE ACCEPTANCE — SIGN IN HERE`. After that gate
passes, StudioFlow's final user-facing acceptance target is the authenticated
live production page. When the owner has authorized live verification, the
existing production tab may be used non-destructively to confirm the exact
visible behavior; do not alter stored studios, media, recordings, or settings.

## Current browser workflow

- Firefox Developer Edition is the default browser for local and production
  TPI acceptance.
- StudioFlow completion is judged against the live production site. Local
  checks remain safety gates but are not substitutes for live acceptance.
- Automated acceptance uses isolated disposable profiles and never closes or
  repurposes the owner's existing local or production tabs.
- Chromium is used only for an explicit compatibility requirement.

The latest retained browser evidence is 278 PASS, 6 expected limitations, 0
FAIL across 284 routes, with 54/54 focused checks passing and zero external
requests. Synthetic local roles are `local_admin`, `local_member`, and
`local_contributor`; credentials must never be printed or copied into reports.

## Recent verified changes

- OPS-018 changed shared fragment URLs in `includes.js` to root-relative paths
  and restaged local assets; the Worker was not restarted.
- The existing browser harness is `scripts/e2e/tpi-ops-016-browser.mjs`.
- Repository-scoped Playwright tooling uses the locally available package and
  installed Chrome without a browser download.
- OPS-019 policy and result records document Codex/FreeBuff/Opera boundaries.

## Last successful checks

- OPS-002 traffic protection: 11/11
- OPS-007 local foundation: 10/10
- OPS-009 authentication: 27/27
- OPS-011 member home: 37/37
- OPS-012 StudioFlow/ParaTube: 26/26
- OPS-014 local service: 20/20
- OPS-015 admin/API QA: 62/62
- `node --check includes.js`: passed
- `node --check scripts/e2e/tpi-ops-016-browser.mjs`: passed
- `git diff --check`: passed

## Safe continuation

Open the affected route in an isolated Firefox Developer Edition profile,
inspect console and local request activity, and run the smallest applicable
test followed by the required regressions. Agents may control the maintained
LaunchAgent services, commit, push, and deploy through `scripts/tpi-release.mjs`
when required. Do not interrupt unrelated services, expose credentials, or use
owner Studios for destructive testing.

No credentials, tokens, private payloads, or secrets are included in this
handoff.

## Documentation synchronization

Every completed TPI directive must update the affected Markdown records before
its status is marked complete. Record changed source files, executed evidence,
known limitations, development status, and the directive-index entry. Do not
describe a feature as production-ready from local tests alone.
